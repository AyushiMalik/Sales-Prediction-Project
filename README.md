## Predictive Analysis::
### Sales Prediction Project
#### Overview: The Project aims to predict Sales for TV, Radio, and Newspaper, Sales. The dataset is from kaggle. The level of observation is for each product.

#### **Project Steps include:
##### 1.) Library Imports:: Importing required libraries for manipulation, cleaning, statistical summary, EDA, visualization, feature scaling, training, and evaluating models.
##### 2.) Data Preprocessing:: Loading the required data from the datasource. Modified dataset by implementing data cleaning, and handling missing values, and duplicate values.
##### 3.) Statistical Summary:: Found the statistical summary of data like mean, count, std, min.
##### 4.) EDA and Data Visualization:: Pioneered EDA and developed bivariate analysis including scatter plots and pairwise plots for better correlation of data.
##### 5.) Encoding and Feature Scaling:: Encoded the text data into numerical values. And performed feature scaling on data for developing effective models.
##### 6.) Splitting Data:: Splitting the dataset into test and train datasets for ML models.
##### 7.) Data Modelling:: I used three different techniques for data modeling i.e. Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor.
